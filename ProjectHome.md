A nice Air Hockey simulation between two player with Python and Pygame.
This game was developed for the course of "Operative System II" of prof. Andrea Pollini at the "Universit√† Cattolica di Brescia".

Tested with Python 2.7.2 (64bit) and Pygame 1.9.2 (pre-release 64bit) under Windows.

To run the game use the command "python main.py" in the main directory.
